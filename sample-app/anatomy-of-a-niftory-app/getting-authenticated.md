# Getting Authenticated

The Niftory Sample App is built on [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), but your app can be built in any framework or language you prefer.

Niftory provides simple GraphQL APIs to query or modify data and performs authentication via OAuth 2.0.

Check out the [Authentication](../../core-concepts/authentication/) section for details on the [types of authentication](broken-reference) we support, and how to [configure your app](../../core-concepts/authentication/configuring-your-app.md) to use it.
