Now that we have gone over some of the core APIs, let's revisit the [Sample App](https://github.com/Niftory/niftory-samples/tree/main/basic-app) and break down its key pieces. These next sections walk through the important aspects of the sample app.

* [**Tech Stack**](getting-authenticated.md): Niftory uses industry standard technologies such as GraphQL and OAuth so you can easily incorporate the APIs into any app. The Sample uses [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), but you can use your framework of choice.&#x20;
* [**App Views**](api-usage.md): See the User's Profile, Available NFTs, Owned NFTs, Wallets and everything else you need to build out the core functionality of an NFT experience.
* [**Transfer an NFT**](transfer-an-nft.md): Put it all together! Transfer an NFT to a user.
