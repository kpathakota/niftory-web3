# Explore the Sample App

Start with cloning the Sample app to get started quickly:

{% embed url="https://github.com/Niftory/niftory-samples" %}
Niftory Samples Git Repo
{% endembed %}

This sample includes everything to get your app off the ground :rocket:

* :closed\_lock\_with\_key:[**Authentication**](../../core-concepts/authentication/)**:** Easily plug-in Niftory Auth to get access to users, their profiles, wallets, NFTs, and everything else your app will need.&#x20;
* &#x20;:credit\_card:[**Wallets**](../../core-concepts/wallets/)**:** Set up and verify wallets for your users.
* [**NFTs**](../../core-concepts/nfts/)**:** Display all of the NFTs that a user owns and everything available to claim.
* [**Claim an NFT**](../../core-concepts/nfts/transferring-nfts.md)**:** Mint and Transfer an NFT into a user's wallet. &#x20;

Every step of the way, your [Admin Portal](https://docs.niftory.com/docs/v/niftory-admin/) will be updated to show you what's happening in your environment, including seeing new users signing up for your Sample App. We'll go over the Admin Portal [in this guide](../../getting-started/niftory-admin-portal.md).

Next, let's do a [quick roundup](../../getting-started/api-cheat-sheet.md) of the entire API surface -- it's ok if something doesn't make sense yet. We will revisit them in depth as we explore the Anatomy of the Sample App, and again when we go over the Core Concepts.
