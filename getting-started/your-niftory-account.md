# Your Niftory Account

## Ready to create your own app?

To get started with your own application, let's get your Niftory API Keys! Login to the [**Niftory Admin Portal**](https://admin.niftory.com/) to create an account and follow these steps:&#x20;

1. You should automatically be redirected to the Your App Page. If not, click on your **User Profile,** and select **App.**&#x20;
2. Click [**Setup and Get Keys**](../core-concepts/authentication/using-your-api-key.md) to get all of your secrets and start building. You can start calling the API now against your own application, but blockchain actions will require a contract, which takes one more step.
3. Select a name for your contract and hit [**Deploy Contract**](../core-concepts/contract.md#contract-deployment). Your smart contract will be created under a brand new blockchain address for your app. Now, you can run blockchain actions

Now you're ready to build your own - we recommend you start with the Niftory Sample App to get the basics set up!&#x20;

### Learn about your Smart Contract

When you start with Niftory, the platform automatically deploys a robust smart contract for you to build with. This smart contract gives you everything you need to mint NFTs and much more. \
\
Before you do any blockchain actions, you'll simply need to name and deploy your smart contract. Don't worry - this is _very_ easy. Just give your Smart Contract a name, hit the Deploy button and after 30 seconds, you should see that your smart contract is ready. You can always view your contract, the address, source code or anything else :tada:
