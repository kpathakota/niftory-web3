# SDK QuickStart

{% hint style="info" %}
Go through the [Niftory Quickstart](../niftory-quickstart.md) before starting this section. The Niftory SDK is a Typescript SDK, designed to streamline development in the JS ecosystem.  This is the easiest way to build your first app with Niftory
{% endhint %}

First, install the Niftory SDK on your project with:

```
yarn add @niftory/sdk
```

Now, you can start creating NFTs, wallets, and more with simple hooks and sdk calls! :tada:

The following guides walk you through how you can use the SDK in your App (in React - including React Native) or from the backend. If you're all set to go, the full SDK reference is available here:
