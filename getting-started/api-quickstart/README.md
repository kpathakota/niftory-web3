# API Quickstart

{% hint style="info" %}
Go through the [Niftory Quickstart](../niftory-quickstart.md) before starting this section.
{% endhint %}

## Set up API Playground

At this point you're fully set up to start building with Niftory. Let's get you a playground to experiment with the API quickly:

### **Clone this** [**GraphQL Playground**](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/Niftory-Staging-1wxews/home?variant=current) **or** [**Postman Collection**](https://www.postman.com/dark-star-402968/workspace/niftory/collection/22409520-3f7f5cea-fe22-4589-beb5-5ff8d6fdca12?ctx=documentation)

Add the values of API Key and Client secret from the previous section to these request headers:

* `X-Niftory-API-Key`
* `X-Niftory-Client-Secret`

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're using Apollo Studio, copy/paste the values into the environment variables section as "`apiKey"` and "`clientSecret`"
{% endhint %}

**Niftory GraphQL Playground**
{% endembed %}

### **Try making API calls**

You can [make API calls against some sample content](api-calls-with-sample-content.md) we've already created.

The next sections walk you through some specific API calls:

{% content-ref url="create-your-first-wallet.md" %}
[create-your-first-wallet.md](create-your-first-wallet.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="mint-your-first-nft.md" %}
[mint-your-first-nft.md](mint-your-first-nft.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## **Learn more about the Niftory API**

{% content-ref url="../../core-concepts/niftory-data-model.md" %}
[niftory-data-model.md](../../core-concepts/niftory-data-model.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../api-cheat-sheet.md" %}
[api-cheat-sheet.md](../api-cheat-sheet.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Ready to create your own app?

Congratulations! You're all set up. We can't wait to see what you build with Niftory. Don't forget to join our [developer community](../../now-available-to-everyone.md) and share what you're building.

{% hint style="success" %}
We recommend you start by cloning the [Niftory Sample App](../../sample-app/niftory-sample-app/) to get the basics light up for free!
